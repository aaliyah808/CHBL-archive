Black Arts Week Imminent
By CLAY EVANS, Staff Writer

One year ago, the Black Student Caucus sponsored the First
Annual Black Arts Week here.
The program came about largely
as a result of efforts of a group
of students, both black and
white, and a few faculty members, who wanted to give recognition and pay tribute to talented black people.
This year's program will commence Sunday morning, April
27th, and end Saturday evening,
May 3rd. Most of the week's
activities were planned by the
Cultural Affairs Committee
(Cleveland Gillis, chairman;
Richard Wells, Denise Banks,
Anita Austin, Janeth Smith,
Greta Johnson, Kurt Maxey and
Lauren Jones) of the BSC.
In addition to the agenda below, a literary magazine containing the works of black students here will be on sale during
the week, along with jewelry
(earrings and beads) designed
by the girls. The art works of
Melvin Hardin, will continue to
be on exhibit in Thorne Hall. In
addition, an art show compiled
by Nathaniel Lacy and consist-
ing of works by Bernie Casey,
Herman Bailey, Bill Maxwell,
and Jean Lacy will be featured
throughout the week. Proceeds
from the week will go to help
establish a scholarship fund for
incoming black students and to
contribute financially to the
Crossroads Africa effort.
