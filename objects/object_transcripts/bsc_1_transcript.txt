The Black Students Caucus Manifesto...
We will not die for nothing
Not anymore
Our deaths shall be noisy and beautiful to the last swing
And deep
Evenly spread all over; without a wrinkle or a tear
We shall die properly, all at once.
Nor more inch by inch
day by day
Or by the hour.
There shall be one crash and one crash only.
We shall go spirit first,
Leaving our bodies dragging in your sleep of us,
While folks cry at our funeral
for themselves in us.
But not us. not anymore baby, no good.
We ain't radical or high
We've thought it all over and
It's marked on your calendar,
Burning on our foreheads.
The Black Student [Caucus] of Occidental College is a fraternal
organization: composed of and entirely for Black students. Our
purposes and functions are extensive and varied, but can in general
terms be expressed as such:
(1) promote the general welfare of black people everywhere
(2) assist this administration and faculty in any and all endeavors concerning Black students.
(3) act as a representative collective body of black students
on the Occidental campus.
(4) assist institutions of higher learning in the furtherance
of an effective multi-cultural experience.
(5) secure and maintain the Black heritage.
In order to insure that our purposes and operational functions
are relative and effective in accomplishing our goals it is necessary that the Black Student Caucus organize and maintain an opera-
ting structure. This inner organization for the 1972-73 academic
year will be composed of the following:
(1) An Executive Chairman
