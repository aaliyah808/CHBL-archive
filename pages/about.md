## About the Critical Hope and Black Life Collection

This collection seeks to preserve the institutional memory of the diverse Black experience and build upon the stories and legacy of Blackness at Occidental College. Artifacts include digitized materials such as yearbooks, newspaper articles, videos, photos, course catalogues, and interviews as well as digital-born documents like web pages and social media posts. Materials focus on campus life, Oxy’s partnerships with organizations that are located in Los Angeles’ Black enclaves and/or serve the populations of LA’s historic Black communities, and student activist movements on campus and in global solidarity. 

[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information.
